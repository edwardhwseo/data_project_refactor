We are pulling data from https://www.balldontlie.io/home.html
Our plan is to create an NBA database you can browse to look at players and their teams.
The player table current is structure likeso:
    {
      "id":237,
      "first_name":"LeBron",
      "last_name":"James",
      "position":"F",
      "height_feet": 6,
      "height_inches": 8,
      "weight_pounds": 250,
      "team":{
        "id":14,
        "abbreviation":"LAL",
        "city":"Los Angeles",
        "conference":"West",
        "division":"Pacific",
        "full_name":"Los Angeles Lakers",
        "name":"Lakers"
      }
    }

The team table current structure is:
{
      "id":14,
      "abbreviation":"LAL",
      "city":"Los Angeles",
      "conference":"West",
      "division":"Pacific",
      "full_name":"Los Angeles Lakers",
      "name":"Lakers"
    },
So our database would need a players table and a teams table.

Player(
  id: int
  first_name: string
  last_name: string
  position: char(2)
  height_feet: int
  height_inches: int
  weight_pounds: int
)

Team(
  id: int
  abbreviation: string
  city: string
  full_name: string
)

Division(
  id: int
  name: string
)

Conference(
  id: int
  name: string
)

As of now we are only using one data source. So no integreation with other datasources will be implemented into our project.
